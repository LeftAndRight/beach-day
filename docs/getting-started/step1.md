# Getting Started (Step 1)

Before we begin: all of the code samples in this tutorial can be found in the [src](src) folder of this directory.

## Project Setup
Before we can begin to use beach-day, we will need to setup a few things.
You will need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) installed and working.

Next you need to setup your project. beach-day is a module that is installed as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) dependency so lets create a new project that we can work from.

First create your new project directory then fire up the command line and `cd` into your project folder.  
From now all commands will assume your command line is placed inside your project.  
Then initalise your project with a [package.json file](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json) using this command:  
```
npm init
```

This process should ask you a number of questions about your project. As your project will not available as a public npm module, you can safely leave all of these as the suggested defaults.  
If successful this should have created a [package.json file](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json) in your project root.
  
  
**Next** install this npm module (beach-day) locally as a dependency using command:  

```
npm install beach-day --save
```
This will download this module and save it as a dependency in the package.json. If you want to commit your project to GIT please remember to ignore the node_modules folder generated by npm, anyone who uses your project can run `npm install` in the root of the project to get all the dependencies again.

## Environment Setup
Now that we have a project setup to use beach day
