# beach-day
beach-day is an npm module designed to make HTTP based API integration testing easy and fun for both sides of the fence (front end & backend).
It was inspired by a lack of mature tools in the current ecosystem and a few projects that attempt to make this possible, namely [frisby](http://frisbyjs.com/) and [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

To install run:
```
npm install beach-day
```
